Description:

Note: game descriptors are ignored during the size check.
Furthermore note that abuse will result in deletion of the game and full ban from all PX services.


The game descriptor file:
A game descriptor is needed for a Phoenix game to launch outside of debug mode, game descriptors contains important launch information.
The launcher searches for files named <gameid>.game, eg. soty.game. The Phoenix API servers automatically append important fields for online play.
The launcher also will search for a file named <gameid>-<majorversion>.game if a version is specified in the launcher binary, you can use this to archive older versions.

The format of a game descriptor file is like this:
   Key: Value
   Key-Two: Another value
